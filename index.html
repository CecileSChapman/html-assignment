            <p><h3>Education and Career Goals</h3>

            <strong>Hello!</strong> First, let me tell you about my post-secondary experience before joining the IMD program.
            Straight out of high school, I initially accepted an offer for the Mathematics for Education program at York University.
            My first year of university was a mess. York University went on strike, I went from getting straight A's in high school, to getting C's and D's. 
            After the strike ended, I ended up failing my Calculus II course and I decided that math didn't give me the same joy as it used to.
            I switched majors to a subject that I love, the Humanities, but it is a <em>very</em> broad subject and hard to start a career with.
            This is what brought me to the IMD program. 
            I wanted something specific and career-focused, but not another long four years of school.
            My ultimate goal is to work from home and design websites or something similar.
