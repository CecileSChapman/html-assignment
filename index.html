                <strong>Hello! I'm Cecile ^-^</strong> 
                <br>
                I'm currently 23 years old and my birthday's February 16<sup>th</sup> 1999.

                    <h3>Education and Career Goals</h3>
                    First, let me tell you about my post-secondary experience before joining the IMD program.
                    Straight out of high school, I initially accepted an offer for the Mathematics for Education program at York University.
                    My first year of university was a mess. York University went on strike, I went from getting straight A's in high school, to getting C's and D's. 
                    After the strike ended, I ended up failing my Calculus II course and I decided that math didn't give me the same joy as it used to.
                    I switched majors to a subject that I love, the Humanities, but it's a <em>very</em> broad subject and hard to start a career with.
                    Although my student career is prolonged because of this, I really enjoyed my time in the Humanities program.
                    <blockquote>The sciences are the <q>how,</q> and the humanities are the <q>why</q> â€” why are we here, why do we believe in the things we believe in. I don't think you can have the <q>how</q> without the <q>why.</q> 
                    <br>-<cite>George Lucas</cite></blockquote>
                    What brought me to the IMD program is that I wanted something specific and career-focused, but not another long four years of school.
                    My ultimate goal is to work from home and design websites or something similar.

            <h3>Personal Interests and Hobbies</h3>
                <section>
                 <h4>Video Games</h4>
                 Outside of school, one of my favourite hobbies is to play video games. I play a variety of relaxing and competitive games. 
                 I enjoy playing games on my Nintendo Switch, as Nintendo games are nostalgic to me. I also play a lot of games on my PC, my current heavy rotation of multiplayer games includes <abbr title="Counter Strike: Global Offensive">CS:GO</abbr>, <abbr title="Dead by Daylight">DBD</abbr> and whatever other games my friends pull me on (Fortnite, Apex Legends).
                 One of my favourite solo games that I've played recently is Assassin's Creed Odyssey and I want to play other games in the franchise.

                 <h4>Food and Cooking</h4>
                 I grew up in a food-loving household and chef as a mother. For this reason, I have an oddly high amount of food knowledge, comparitively to my friends.
                 I like looking for new types of food to both eat and cook myself. Recently, my favourite food to cook is Korean spicy brasied tofu.

                    <h4>Music</h4>
                    The last of my big three hobbies is music! I love singing, performing, and watching others perform. I love seeing bands live, especially to support local or smaller bands.
